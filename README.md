================================

Description
------------

`nagios-plugins` pretend to be a collection of various customized plugins that my
mates and I, have written and expanded over the last 2 years or so, working a monitoring
area in a pretty popular company.

They have mostly written in Perl/Bash

####Example of use:  
  Suppose you have a log file named `log_file.log` with the following format:
  
    Performance Statistics   2013-08-26 17:04:00 - 2013-08-26 17:05:00
    Tag                           Avg(ms)         Min         Max     Std Dev       Count
    label1                            0.0           0           0         0.0           2
    label2                            0.5           0           1         0.5           2
    label3                            0.2           0         134         2.9        2588
    label4                            5.0           5           5         0.0           1
    label5                           12.3          10          18         2.2          15
    label6                           38.1           0         996        63.3        1765
    label7                            0.4           0          24         2.1         192
  
  So, if you would like to parse Avg time \(first column\) of, for example, label1 and label5:
  
  
    $ ./log4j_parser.pl -p 'log_file.log' -s 'label1+label5' -C 1
    LOG4J_PARSER OK - All stats retrieved | label1=0.0;; label5=12.3;;
